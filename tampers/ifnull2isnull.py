    Replaces instances like 'IFNULL(A, B)' with 'IF(ISNULL(A), B, A)' counterpart

    Requirement:
        * MySQL
        * SQLite (possibly)
        * SAP MaxDB (possibly)

    Tested against:
        * MySQL 5.0 and 5.5

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass very weak and bespoke web application firewalls
          that filter the IFNULL() function
