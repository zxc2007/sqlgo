    Replaces greater than operator ('>') with 'NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #' and equals operator ('=') with 'BETWEEN # AND #'

    Tested against:
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005
        * MySQL 4, 5.0 and 5.5
        * Oracle 10g
        * PostgreSQL 8.3, 8.4, 9.0

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass weak and bespoke web application firewalls that
          filter the greater than character
        * The BETWEEN clause is SQL standard. Hence, this tamper script
          should work against all (?) databases

    >>> tamper('1 AND A > B--')
    '1 AND A NOT BETWEEN 0 AND B--'
    >>> tamper('1 AND A = B--')
    '1 AND A BETWEEN B AND B--'
    >>> tamper('1 AND LAST_INSERT_ROWID()=LAST_INSERT_ROWID()')
