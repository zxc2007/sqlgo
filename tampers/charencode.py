    URL-encodes all characters in a given payload (not processing already encoded) (e.g. SELECT -> %53%45%4C%45%43%54)

    Tested against:
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005
        * MySQL 4, 5.0 and 5.5
        * Oracle 10g
        * PostgreSQL 8.3, 8.4, 9.0

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass very weak web application firewalls that do not url-decode the request before processing it through their ruleset
        * The web server will anyway pass the url-decoded version behind, hence it should work against any DBMS
