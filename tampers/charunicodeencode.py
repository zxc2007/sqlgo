    Unicode-URL-encodes all characters in a given payload (not processing already encoded) (e.g. SELECT -> %u0053%u0045%u004C%u0045%u0043%u0054)

    Requirement:
        * ASP
        * ASP.NET

    Tested against:
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2000
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005
        * MySQL 5.1.56
        * PostgreSQL 9.0.3

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass weak web application firewalls that do not unicode URL-decode the request before processing it through their ruleset
